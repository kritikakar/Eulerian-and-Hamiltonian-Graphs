    "In 1736, Leonhard Euler showed that there was no way to travel across the [Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg), crossing each bridge a single time and ending up where you started. He did this by showing that there is no *Eulerian circuit* in a graph representing the city, where vertices represent landmasses and edges represent bridges between them. This established the first result in graph theory.\n",

In other words, it is a cycle which contains every edge of the graph precisely once. You can think about this as some way of travelling around the graph, crossing each edge precisely once. Note that this does **not** mean that each vertex has to be visited precisely once (or even at all!)\n",
